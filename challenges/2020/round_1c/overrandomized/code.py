Overrandomized
https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/000000000019fef4/00000000003179a1

- The server returns a random integer between 1 and M inclusive, M <= 10**U
- Each server replaces the digits by letters. For example CODEJAMFUN would be 0123456789
- The numbers don't have leading zeros, so that gives an easy way to find which letter is zero
- For each server we make 10**4 queries with random M âˆˆ [1, 10**U - 1]
- We are requested to recover the secret digit to letter translation

The key detail is that for the test set 3 there is no information about M. Thus the distribution
should not be random. The point is that if we concatenate two random distributions the output is not
random. There would be more numbers starting by 1 than 2, more starting than 2 than 3 and so on.
