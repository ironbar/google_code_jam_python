Overrandomized

- The server returns a random integer between 1 and M inclusive, M <= 10**U
- Each server replaces the digits by letters. For example CODEJAMFUN would be 0123456789
- The numbers don't have leading zeros, so that gives an easy way to find which letter is zero
- For each server we make 10**4 queries with random M âˆˆ [1, 10**U - 1]
- We are requested to recover the secret digit to letter translation
